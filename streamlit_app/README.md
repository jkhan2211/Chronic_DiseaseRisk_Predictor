# Description 

The streamlit_app/ directory contains the front-end interface of the Disease Feature Classification.
It provides an interactive Streamlit-based UI where users can enter symptoms, visualize model outputs, and explore predictions generated by the backend API.

This folder represents the presentation layer of the project — everything that users see and interact with, separate from backend logic and model operations.
